# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

TO DO: 
-pull in contact form in contact file
-update app file
-add third profile link
-finish adding projects (need 2 more)
-add resume to download
-write actual readme
-routing?? (make sure that browser URL is updated when page changes)
-add info to about me 
-update color scheme to use something other than bootstrap defaults
